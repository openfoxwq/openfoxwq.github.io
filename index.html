        <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
        <h3>What happens to openfoxwq browser application?</h3>
        I won't develop it further. Instead, I will focus on minifoxwq. The site will be up until around new year
        (2024), after which it will be taken down. If you enjoyed openfoxwq, you will probably like minifoxwq. You can
        read a bit more about the rationale <a
            href="https://discord.com/channels/1077299199684653126/1077299200129241098/1166097808579907675">here</a>.
        <h3>Why is minifoxwq not open-source?</h3>
        The source code contains details about the protocol which I'm afraid could be used by some malicious parties to
        do more than a simple third-party client for compatibility purposes. Thus, since the goal is provide a viable
        alternative for those who want to play on Fox and do not have a Windows system, I decided to keep it
        closed-source for the time being and distribute it as shareware. Additionally, note that since the client is
        built by reverse engineering the protocol, this is against their ToS and I would prefer to minimize the risk of
        them taking legal action against me.
        <h3>Will my account get banned if I use minifoxwq?</h3>
        Possibly. However, I'm not aware of anyone's account being banned during the lifetime of the client (almost a
        year now) and I doubt they will take any action unless the accounts are used for explicit malicious purposes
        rather than just interacting regularly with their servers.
        <h3>Is the score-estimator supported?</h3>
        Yes, since version v0.10.
        <h3>Why is this website so ugly?</h3>
        ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
